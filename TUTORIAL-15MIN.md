- User enters their favorite words
- The app generates creative band names
- Simple frontend with HTML/CSS/JavaScript

**Why this project**:
- ‚úÖ Simple but fun
- ‚úÖ Shows Claude's capabilities
- ‚úÖ Works in the browser
- ‚úÖ Doesn't require database or complex backend

## üìã Step 1: Install Claude Code (3 minutes)

### 1.1 - Open VS Code

Open Visual Studio Code.

### 1.2 - Install the Extension

1. Click on the **Extensions** icon (square with puzzle pieces)
2. Search: `Claude Code`
3. Click **Install** on Anthropic's extension

**Wait 30-60 seconds** while it installs.

### 1.3 - Verify Installation

You should see:
- ‚úÖ A Claude icon in the left sidebar
- ‚úÖ A new panel called "Claude Code"

**If you DON'T see it**: Restart VS Code and check again.

## üîë Step 2: Configure API Key (2 minutes)

### 2.1 - Get your API Key

1. Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Log in or create an account
3. Go to **"API Keys"**
4. Click **"Create Key"**
5. **Copy** your API key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Save this key in a safe place. You'll need it.

### 2.2 - Configure the Key in your Terminal

**Mac/Linux**:
```bash
# Open your terminal
# Paste this command (replace xxx with your key):
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-xxxxx"

# Verify it worked:
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# Should show your key
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**:
```powershell
# Open PowerShell
# Paste this command (replace xxx with your key):
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-xxxxx"

# Verify it worked:
echo $env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# Should show your key
```

### 2.3 - Restart VS Code

**VERY IMPORTANT**: Close VS Code COMPLETELY and reopen it.

This ensures VS Code sees the new environment variable.

## üèóÔ∏è Step 4: Create the Project (5 minutes)

### 4.1 - Create Project Folder

```bash
# In your terminal
mkdir band-name-generator
cd band-name-generator

# Open VS Code in this folder
code .
```

### 4.2 - Ask Claude to Create the App

**Open Claude Code** (icon in the sidebar) and paste this prompt:

```
Create a Band Name Generator web app with the following requirements:

1. A single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
2. User can input 2-3 words they like
3. Click a button to generate creative band names
4. Show 5 different band name suggestions
5. Modern, fun design with gradients
6. No external dependencies - pure HTML/CSS/JS

The file should be called index.html and be ready to open in a browser.
```

### 4.3 - Wait for Claude to Create the File

Claude should:
1. Create an `index.html` file
2. Write all the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code
3. Show you the code

**Time**: 30-60 seconds

### 4.4 - Verify the File Exists

In VS Code, you should see:
```
band-name-generator/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
```

---

## üé® Step 5: Test the App (2 minutes)

### 5.1 - Open in Browser

**Option 1 - Double click**:
- Go to your `band-name-generator` folder
- Double click on `index.html`
- Opens in your browser

**Option 2 - VS Code Extension** (recommended):
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right click on `index.html`
3. Click on "Open with Live Server"

### 5.2 - Test the App

1. Enter 2-3 words (e.g., "Fire", "Dragon", "Night")
2. Click on "Generate Band Names"
3. You should see 5 generated band names

**Examples of generated names**:
- "Firedrake Nights"
- "Dragon's Inferno"
- "Nightfire Chronicles"
- etc.

**If it works**: Congratulations! üéâ You just created your first app with Claude Code.

## üîß Step 6: Customize the App (3 minutes)

Now let's make changes so you can see how Claude helps you iterate.

### 6.1 - Change the Color

Ask Claude:

```
Change the color scheme to dark mode with purple and blue gradients
```

Claude should:
1. Update the `index.html` file
2. Change the CSS colors
3. Show you what changed

### 6.2 - Add More Features

Ask Claude:

```
Add a "Copy to Clipboard" button next to each generated band name
```

Claude should:
1. Add copy buttons
2. Implement the JavaScript functionality
3. Update the HTML

### 6.3 - Test the Changes

Reload the page in your browser (F5) and test:
- Did the color scheme change?
- Do the "Copy" buttons appear?
- Do they work when clicked?

## üéì Step 7: Understand What Happened (2 minutes)

### What You Just Did

1. ‚úÖ Installed Claude Code
2. ‚úÖ Configured your API key
3. ‚úÖ Asked Claude to create an app
4. ‚úÖ Claude wrote ALL the code for you
5. ‚úÖ Tested the app
6. ‚úÖ Asked for changes and Claude made them

### The Power of This

**Before** (without Claude Code):
```
1. Search for tutorial on Google
2. Copy/paste code from StackOverflow
3. Debug errors
4. Search for more tutorials
5. More errors
6. 2-3 hours later: it works
```

**Now** (with Claude Code):
```
1. Describe what you want
2. Claude creates it
3. It works
4. 5-10 minutes
```

**Time reduction**: ~90-95% ‚ö°

> Add a "Favorites" section where users can save their favorite names

> Add a "Random" mode that generates names without user input

> Add animations when names appear

> Make it responsive for mobile devices
```

**Option 2 - Build another app**:
- Calculator
- Unit converter
- Todo list (Todo app)
- Password generator

**Option 3 - Learn more**:
- Read the [Cheat Sheet](./CHEATSHEET.md) for common prompts
- Review [more complex examples](./examples/README.md)
- Read [Best Practices](./docs/06-best-practices.md)

## üí° Tips and Tricks

### How to Write Good Prompts

‚ùå **Bad**:
```
Create an app
```

‚úÖ **Good**:
```
Create a weather app that:
- Shows current temperature
- Uses OpenWeather API
- Has a search bar for cities
- Shows 5-day forecast
- Responsive design
```

### If Something Doesn't Work

1. **Read the error**: Claude sometimes explains what failed
2. **Be specific**: "Fix the error in line 45"
3. **Iterate**: Ask for small changes, not rewriting everything
4. **Ask for explanations**: "Explain what this code does"

### Useful Claude Commands

```bash
/help    # Show help
/plan    # Claude plans before coding
/clear   # Clear chat
```

## ‚ùì Common Problems

### "API key not found"

**Solution**:
1. Verify you configured it: `echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
2. Restart VS Code COMPLETELY
3. Reconfigure if necessary

### Claude is very slow

**Solution**:
1. Switch to a faster model (haiku):
   - Settings ‚Üí Claude Code ‚Üí Model ‚Üí `claude-haiku-3.5`

### The code doesn't work

**Solution**:
1. Ask Claude to fix it:
   ```
   This gives an error: [paste error]
   Fix it
   ```

### I don't know what to build

**Simple ideas for practice**:
- Tip calculator
- Temperature converter
- Random color generator
- Stopwatch/Timer
- Shopping list
